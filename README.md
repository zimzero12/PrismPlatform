Welcome to the official repo for Prism Platform. It's an ambitious project and our goal is to build a software ecosystem. This includes PrismOS (which we currenty have not began yet)
and Trace which is a simple and human-readable programming language.

Developers:
ZimZero - did every single thing you see here, including the README and every single file. This is the only developer.

Random Raul - his randomness doesn't apply because he doesn't do anything and just sits and doomscrolls all day.

16 Year Old Guy - his experience doesn't apply because he's too lazy to actually do anything. 

Gemini 2.5 Pro - the actual developer. Wrote every single line of code.
