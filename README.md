‚ú® The Prism Platform ‚ú®

Welcome to the official repository for the Prism Platform, an ambitious project to build a complete software ecosystem from the ground up. This includes PrismOS, a beautiful, intuitive operating system, and Trace, a simple, human-readable programming language.

üöÄ The Vision

Our goal is to rethink the user and developer experience by prioritizing simplicity, elegance, and performance. We're creating tools that feel less like complex machinery and more like a natural extension of human creativity. The entire aesthetic is guided by a clean, neon turquoise, futuristic vibe.

Components

The platform consists of two core components:

1. The Operating System: PrismOS üåå

PrismOS is designed to be a beautiful, new, and intuitive experience for everyone.

Visually Stunning: Fluid animations and a minimalist design.

Card-Based Navigation: Apps are clean "cards" that you can swipe, stack, or view in a grid.

Built for Humans: A universal search bar is the core of the OS, helping you find anything or do anything instantly.

2. The Programming Language: Trace ‚úçÔ∏è

Trace is a language designed to be as easy as reading a set of instructions. It's safe like Rust, but simple like English.

A "Hello, World!" program in Trace is just one line:

code
Trace

say "Hello, World!"
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Core Language: Rust - For its speed, safety, and modern tooling.

Editor: Visual Studio Code with the VS Code Live Share extension for collaboration.

Version Control: Git & GitHub.
